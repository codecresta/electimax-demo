Electimax
---------

Electimax is a piece of software designed to solve multiple-choice knapsack problems. Simply put Electimax allows you to select the a combination of items (or "projects") from a series of multiple-choices, in order to get the overall best "bang for buck".

This file refers to the demonstration version of the software Electimax 1.0.

The software is similar to the full version except that the problem sizes that it can handle are severely limited,
also there is a utility function not available in the demonstration version. The full version of the software is
available, and contains some minor improvements that the demonstration version does not have. See the contact details below.

On a Debian based Linux system
------------------------------

To install the Debian package file "electimaxdemopkg.deb", download the file to a directory e.g. "~/Downloads", then
either:
1. double click the file
or:
2. open a terminal window, cd (change directory) to the directory where the file resides (i.e. to the directory where
it was saved) and use the command:
sudo dpkg --install electimaxdemopkg.deb

To uninstall open a terminal window and use the command:
dpkg --remove electimaxdemopkg

On a Microsoft® Windows® based system
-------------------------------------

To install copy the executable file "Electimax-demo.exe" to a suitable directory (create one if necessary) e.g.
"C:/Program Files/Electimax". Create a shortcut to this file if required.

The file "Demo1.emx" can be loaded into the program, and solved using the "tools" menu.
